# Skyview – Castle Hill

Skyview is a large-scale residential apartment development located at 51–53 Old Castle Hill Road, Castle Hill, NSW, comprising five towers set within landscaped parklands.[web:18][web:19] The project delivers modern high‑rise living with a focus on community, convenience, and connectivity in Sydney’s Hills District.[web:18][web:19]

## Project overview

- Location: Castle Hill, New South Wales, Australia.[web:18][web:19]  
- Address: 51–53 Old Castle Hill Road, Castle Hill NSW 2154.[web:18][web:19]  
- Type: High‑rise residential apartment complex.  
- Scale: Approximately 900+ apartments across up to five towers, with capacity for around 2,500 residents in the completed development.[web:18][web:19][web:21]  
- Developer (original): Toplace.[web:18][web:19]  
- Current delivery partner: ALAND, appointed to complete remaining buildings and rectify basement defects.[web:14][web:15][web:21]  

Skyview is designed as a masterplanned community that balances private residential spaces with generous communal amenities and green open areas.[web:18][web:19]

## Architecture and design

- Five distinct towers: Phoenix, Hydra, Vela, Lyra, and Carina.[web:18][web:19]  
- Building heights: Up to 23 levels, positioned to capture both urban and Blue Mountains views.[web:18][web:19]  
- Site planning: Towers are carefully spaced to maximise sunlight and airflow to apartments and shared open spaces.[web:18]  
- Interiors: Modern kitchens with SMEG appliances, mirror splashbacks, stone benchtops, and air‑conditioned bedrooms with contemporary bathrooms.[web:19]  

The overall design aims for a timeless character through high‑quality materials while giving each tower its own identity within a cohesive precinct.[web:18][web:19]

## Amenities and community features

Residents benefit from a range of shared facilities intended to support a vibrant community lifestyle.[web:18][web:19]

- Landscaped parklands and central courtyard areas.  
- Communal BBQ areas and outdoor seating.  
- Swimming pool and outdoor gym facilities.  
- Children’s playground and community room.  
- Secure car parking, visitor parking, and bicycle storage.[web:18][web:19]  

Skyview provides a clear separation between public, communal, and private areas, giving residents options for social activity as well as quiet retreat.[web:18]

## Location and connectivity

Skyview is positioned opposite Castle Towers Shopping Centre and within walking distance of Castle Hill Metro Station.[web:18][web:19] The development connects residents to:

- Major retail, dining, and entertainment at Castle Towers.[web:18][web:19]  
- Castle Hill Metro for convenient access to the Sydney CBD and wider metropolitan network.[web:18][web:19]  
- Local parks, schools, and services across the Hills District.[web:18]  

Castle Hill is transitioning from predominantly low‑density housing to a higher‑density urban centre supported by new transport infrastructure, positioning Skyview as part of this growth corridor.[web:18]

## Project status

Following issues with the original developer, ALAND has been engaged to complete the remaining three buildings and rectify structural concerns in the shared basement.[web:14][web:15][web:21] The completed development is expected to deliver around 964 apartments in total, significantly adding to local housing and build‑to‑rent stock in North‑West Sydney.[web:14][web:15][web:21]
